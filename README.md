The goal of this project is to develop a robust encryption application that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using advanced algorithms, specifically AES-256, while providing a user-friendly interface.
File Encryption and Decryption: The application enables users to encrypt and decrypt files using the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the cryptography library, which is built on AES-256. Users can select multiple files for batch processing.

User -Friendly Interface: Built using Tkinter, the application features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily navigate through encryption and decryption processes.

Key Generation and Management: Each encryption operation generates a unique encryption key, which is displayed to the user. Users are advised to store this key securely, as it is required for decryption.

File Type Filtering: The application includes file type filters in the file selection dialogs, allowing users to easily choose the appropriate files for encryption or decryption.

Help and Documentation: A help section provides users with guidance on how to use the application, including instructions for encrypting and decrypting files and the importance of key management.

Error Handling: The application includes error handling to manage exceptions gracefully, providing users with informative error messages if operations fail.
